Vehicle Data Analysis and Insights
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to vehicles, including features such as make, model, year, price, mileage, and more. The goal is to clean the data, perform exploratory analysis, and build predictive models that can provide insights into various vehicle-related metrics, such as price estimation and fuel efficiency prediction.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and prepared the dataset for further analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key trends and relationships between different features (e.g., price vs. mileage).
Feature Engineering: Created new features to improve the accuracy of machine learning models.
Predictive Modeling: Developed models to predict vehicle prices based on relevant features using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Reporting: Summarized findings and provided actionable insights for users
